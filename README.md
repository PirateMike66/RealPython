# RealPython
 RealPython coursework from RealPython.com working through the course work.
Nothing for public consumption in this repository, unless you just feel like
looking over my shoulder. I have been wading in the shallow end of the pool
with python for a long while. I belive with this course as a set of water
wings, I'll venture out a bit further, and finally learn to swim.
